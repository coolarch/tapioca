Tapioca does not try to be, nor is it, the Spring framework. If you need a high quality and full featured IoC/DI container, by all means investigate using Spring or Google's Guice.\r\n\r\nIf you need an extremely lightweight container that has zero external dependencies, Tapioca is what you need.\r\n\r\n## Getting the library\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is targeted at users of Maven, however, those that are using build systems other than those that support Maven artifact repositories, you can download the tapioca-core.jar (and optionally tapioca-utilities.jar) from this web site and include it in your projects classpath by manual means.\r\n\r\nTo use the tapioca-core library, add the following to the dependencies section of your pom.xml file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>com.unboundedprime.tapioca</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>tapioca-core</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>1.0.0</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use the tapioca-utilities add-on, add the following to dependencies section of your pom.xml file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>com.unboundedprime.tapioca</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>tapioca-utilities</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>1.0.0</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using the library\r\n\r\n### Creating the context file\r\n\r\nFirst you will want to create a context file and include it somewhere in your classpath where it may be accessed by your program. In Maven, this can be accomplished by placing it in a sub-folder of your choosing that is below the src/main/resources/ directory in your project's project directory.\r\n\r\n### Example context syntax\r\n\r\nA context file example below uses a format accepted by the java.beans.XMLDecoder class that ships with the standard Java classpath. It is further documented at the article [Long Term Persistence of JavaBeans Components: XML Schema](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/persistence3-139471.html). The Tapioca library acts as a facade to this loader.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\r\n<java>\r\n\r\n\t<object id=\"childClassInstance\" class=\"com.unboundedprime.tapioca.core.ChildTestClass\">\r\n\t\t<void property=\"text\">\r\n\t\t\t<string>Hello World!</string>\r\n\t\t</void>\r\n\t</object>\r\n\r\n\t<object id=\"parentClassInstance\" class=\"com.unboundedprime.tapioca.core.ParentTestClass\">\r\n\t\t<void property=\"child\">\r\n\t\t\t<object idref=\"childClassInstance\"/>\r\n\t\t</void>\r\n\t</object>\r\n\r\n</java>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Loading the context into a container instance\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfinal Container instance = Container.Builder.buildContainerFromXmlInClasspath(\"context.xml\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Extract an implementation\r\n\r\nYou can extract from the context based one of the interfaces it implements, or the class itself.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfinal MyService myService = instance.getObjectThatImplementsOrNull(MyService.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Extract all that implement\r\n\r\nYou can extract a List of multiple implementations from the container as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfinal List<MyService> myServices = instance.getObjectsThatImplement(MyService.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis option allows for multiple implementations to be discovered for dynamic use in your application.\r\n\r\n# Current Status\r\n\r\nTapioca 1.0.0 has been released into the Maven central repository. A non-Maven downloadable version is also being prepared and will be made available here in the downloads section shortly.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
